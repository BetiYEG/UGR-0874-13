    Prof. Tassew WoldeHana,to launch the renovation project at the hospital on Friday afternoon.Dr. Lia said the renov-
    ations project is a part of themMinistry’s push to “create a patient-centered and conducive workenvironment to this
    ensurequality of medical care” in hospitals.

    The 100 million birr renovation project is supported by the World Bank, according to ministry of health.The project

    Established in 1972, Black Lion is the largest general public hospital in Ethiopia.The ministry transferred it to Addis

    students, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and laboratory technicians.ETHIOPIA Black Lion, the largest referral hospital
    in Ethiopia, has announced plans to build its own private hospital within the next five to ten years as the hospital 
    strives for autonomy from the federal government and financial self-sufficiency.

    The hospital, which is under Addis Ababa University, will continue to provide free and low-cost services while building
    its own private hospital.
                    
    "The decision to build the private hospital stems from the move to make Addis Ababa University autonomous in a few months,"
     said Andualem Deneke (MD), CEO of the College of Health Sciences under Addis Ababa University.</P></section>
